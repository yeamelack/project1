How to Compile Program:

In the terminal type:
1. "make N=x" where x is the number of binaries you want to create, or you can also do "make" to create the default number
2. "./autograder <B> <pi>"   <B> = batch size, <pi> = test input parameters (can have multiple, each seperated with a space), they are integers
3. "make clean N=x" where x is the number of binaries to remove, or you can do "make clean" to remove the default number

Assumptions:
We were told by one of the ta's that the use of the timer functions were optional, so we just used a counter.
